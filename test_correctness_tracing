# The purpose of this script is to automatically test a new QBF solver against
# a known-to-be-correct QBF solver on a set of random QBFs. This script assumes that
# in its running directory, there is
#
#       QBFuzz         in file  qbfuzz.py
#       Delta debugger in file  dd-discrepancy.sh
#
# NOTE: The script will generate formula instances into a file called formula,
# therefore any data in that file will be overwritten.
